# Overview

This is a C++ 23 header-only library called `codex`. All functionality is sorted into what I have decided to call them "
Chapters." Each chapter is directed to focus on their area, e.g. `str.hpp` is focusing on string manipulations. As of
now, there is only the chapter str, which is a helper for common string
operations. All code is tested with the Google Test framework. The main philosophy is that the return value
could either be the actual value expected or an error code for failure using the `expected` class from the `expected`
header. The library is designed to be straightforward to use and understand, with clear and concise documentation for
each function. No dependencies are required. No exceptions are thrown.
